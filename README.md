# Project: SHFTR

### What Is The Problem?

There is often a question bicyclist ask themselves that falls into a chasm without a seeable solution - how do I get a public safety issue solved? Letâ€™s say you are bicycling home from work as you do every evening and come across that one particular intersection that is incredibly dangerous to navigate or that stretch of road that is so poorly lit that you encounter several seemingly invisible potholes, which harbor the potential to hospitalize everyone who passes. Who will listen to our cries for improved road safety? Which city agency will prioritize the potholes, broken street lamps or dangerous intersections that desperately need attention? Does one letter, email or phone call amass the momentum required to redirect the resources needed to resolve these issues and more importantly does anyone care? SHFTR offers a new way to answer these questions.

### SHFTR Is The Solution!

SHFTR is a community driven application that provides a platform for bicyclist to create projects that give weight to problems they encounter daily. After signing up with SHFTR a user can locate that pothole, poorly lit street or dangerous intersection on a map and dynamically add a category icon and description of the issue. Once published other users can view the proposed project, comment and ultimately decide the value of the project by voting it up or down. Once a project has amassed enough momentum the community driven data collected by SHFTR will be visible to all and available to the city, town, council, representative or whomever needs to see it in order to affect change.

[DEPLOYED VERSION](https://serene-castle-95327.herokuapp.com/)

### Steps to run locally (please do!):

1. clone repo `git clone git@github.com:xezian/project-init.git`
2. navigate to the root directory of the cloned project `/project-init`
3. type `npm install`
4. if you haven't already, install the npm mysql package globally `npm install mysql -g`
5. login to mysql command line `mysql -u root -p (your password for localhost)`
6. exit the command line `exit` Bye
7. on the mysql command line, run the schema `\. db/schema.sql`
8. run the application in dev mode (locally) `npm run dev`

### Technologies used:

* MySQL for our relational database management system, witth sequelize.js as our ORM framework
* Node.js for server side architecture
* Express server to manage routing and connection with the server
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) for client-side UI
* [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/) for authentication.
* Tape and Nightmare for testing

# SHFTR Application Architecture

#Google Map Integration

The Google Map integration uses a react module called "react google maps", this is a wrapper for the google maps api that allows for some dynamic rendering of markers and results.  AirBnb and Zillow have similar implementation of dynamic rendering, updating the DOM with the appropriate markers for the zoomed area of a map and correlating their data with data displayed in a sidebar.

##Markers

The React module has a component for Markers that allows a variety of information to be displayed, from InfoWindows 

Currently the Markers are rendered from a JSON object with corresponding data to our database, in the future we would like to grab this info directly from our database allowing seamless rendering of projects.

##Marker Clusters

We also used the Marker Cluster component of the module.  This groups tightly spaced clusters of Markers into a single button that zooms in on the map to spread the markers out adequately for easy viewing.

##Features to add
In the future we would like to implement a function that would allow Markers to be placed dynamically on the map, opening a corresponding InfoWindow that would allow users to fill out a form to submit a new project.  This data would be stored into our database with corresponding user information, and the map component reloaded to render the new Project.  This will require a custom constructor for the map and marker components.
